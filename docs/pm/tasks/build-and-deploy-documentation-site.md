# Build and Deploy Documentation Site

The documentation needs to be built by something like mdbook and then deployed to an external site like GitHub Pages or netlify. 

Resources:

- [mdBook Docs](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html)
- [mdBook Automated Deployment](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook/wiki/Automated-Deployment)
