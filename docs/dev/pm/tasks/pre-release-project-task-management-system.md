# Pre-Release Project/Task Management System

A local project/task management system needs to be implemented that will be used prior to the 1.0.0 release of BreachTaskOps to properly track what needs doing. Initially Kanbn has been setup to facilitate this, but it is not ideal as it lacks a large amount of features we require.

Once v1.0.0 is released, we will migrate away from this system in favour of utilizing BreachTaskOps itself to manage the project.

## Sub-tasks

- [ ] Gather potential options
- [ ] Decide from the list of potential options which system to use
- [ ] Implement the new system
- [ ] Export initial systems data to the new system
