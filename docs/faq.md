# Frequently Asked Questions <!-- omit from toc -->

This document goes through the most frequently asked questions we receive about BreachTaskOps.

Due to BreachTaskOps being very early in developmnent we have yet to receive any questions, so for now we have included
some potential FAQ's to fill it.

## Really, another task management command-line app?

We decided to develop BreachTaskOps for a few reasons, these reasons are,

1. A task management command-line app is a simple enough project to learn the Rust language whilst also being complex
enough to challenge us.
2. Frustration with how the majority of command-line task managers deal with task storage, and how most disallow or make
it difficult to create local workspace/project-based tasks and still maintain access to the global task list.
3. All other task/project management CLI solutions did not meet our entire criterion.

We are aware that a task/project management command-line tool is not a novel idea, but still hope to provide a unique
solution to this common problem.

## Why didn't you choose 'x' language?
<!-- SCRATCH: Opening paragraph explaining the section -->
<!-- SCRATCH: Why we chose Rust
        - Language I wanted to learn
        - Widely Portable
        - Memory Safe
        - High Performance
        - Native Concurrency and Parralelism Support
        - Possibility of Minified Binary Size, with small tweaks
        - Tooling and Build Systems Included
        - Memory Efficient
-->
<!-- SCRATCH: Why we didn't choose other languages
        - Already Familiar with the Language
        - Not Performant Enough: JS, TS, Python
        - Not Memory Safe: C++, C
        - Not Easily Portable: C++, C
        - Binary Size Too Large: C# and Java
