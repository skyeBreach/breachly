# Product Plan and Roadmap <!-- omit from toc -->

This document details BreachTaskOps' overall goals, the current implementation/release status, general timeline, and
it's long-term plans.

> [!NOTE]
>
> In the future it is likely that this file will fall out of practice, once we finalize our project management systems.
> Once it does fall out of practice we will make sure to keep it here for historical sake, and convert this notice into
> a warning or caution.
>
> However even with this stated, it is unlikely to happen until we are close to, or past the v1.0 release, so for now we
> will act like this doc will out live us.

## Overview
<!-- SCRATCH: Who this document is for, What this document does, Why its needed, and how it does it -->
<!-- SCRATCH: Briefly explain how this project manages features and issues -->

> We will finish this section asap, for a sneak peak check the markdown comments above me.

To view a complete list of tasks that need to be completed for a given version, or generic tag (type, scope, etc),
please refer to the [task board](/docs/dev/pm/task-board.md) document in the
[pm (project management)](/docs/dev/pm/index.md) directory. This directory and more specifically document are used
internally to keep track of any tasks, and their completion status, that BreachTaskOps must complete and for a given
release, aswell as tracking any ideas we have for the project.

### Release and Build Status

This section specifies a build status for the most up-to date release(s), aswell as any status of the pipelines the build
utilizes (e.g. testing, documentation, etc).

> [!NOTE]
>
> As no release has been made yet, we cannot provide a status for the current build; A build status will be specified here
> once a release has been made.
>

The following table specifies the build status' for the most up-to/current date builds (stable, canary, etc), all major
builds, and any build that shares the same major as the current release. In the case the most up-to date build is the
only build present we will also strive to include at least two stable prior minor or major builds for the sake of
backwards compatibility.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Release</th>
        <th>Branch</th>
        <th>Build Status</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0.1.0</td>
        <td>Stable</td>
        <td>Unknown</td>
    </tr>
</table>


### Timeline

This section specifies the current timeline till the next major build, but doesnt try to expand further than that
limiter. Only specifying (or guessing in most cases) up to the next major build gives us enough leeway to make wrong
predictions without causing any major distruption, whilst still allowing us to plan far enough ahead and think of what
exciting features and systems the future could hold for BreachTaskOps.

The following sections lay out the timeline into major version numbers, and are formatted as such,

```
#### v<current-major> to v<next-major> Release Timeline
```

Each section will try to be as general as possible, as to not make false-promises but in certain cases we may be
specific when our goals need to be, or we get too excited when planning/designing.

<!-- SCRATCH: What the timeline is currently looking like for version 1.0.0 release -->

> We will finish this section asap, for a sneak peak check the markdown comments above me.

#### v0 to v1 Release Timeline
<!-- SCRATCH: What would v1 look like -->
<!-- SCRATCH: When do we hope to have v1 released -->
<!-- SCRATCH: How we intend to meet these goals -->
<!-- SCRATCH: Why do we want v1 too look like this -->

> We will fill this out asap, for a sneak peak check the markdown comments above me.

## Roadmap

This section lays out the intended features and fixes for a given release. All changes provided for a given release are
only intended, and are not guaranteed; a specific change may not appear if it ends up going out of scope for the
release, or requires more time than can be allotted for the release.

Whilst we will always try and strive to be accurate this is not always possible. In the case that we have overestimated
our capability for a specific release, we will strive to update it here and schedule the change for a new release.

Each subsection below denotes a given semantic-versioned release, where the the patch number has been
omitted to minify the expected bloat of this document. As our release numbering follows
[semantic-versioning](https://semver.org/) each section will follow the format,

```
### v<major>.<minor> Release
```

where the three preceding sharps indicate that each header will be at the third level.

We will always strive to include three upcoming minor releases ahead of what is the current release in the following
sections. Whilst we strive for this it may not always be possible due to our internal team being small and having
regular lives outside this, as this project is no team members full time job.

### v0.1 Release
<!-- #1 Themes of the Release -->
<!-- #1 intended Features -->

<!-- SCRATCH: Overview & Intention Paragraph -->
<!-- SCRATCH: List of Themes of the Release -->
<!-- SCRATCH: Intended Features List -->

> We will fill this out asap, for a sneak peak check the markdown comments above me.

### v0.2 Release

> We will fill this out asap, for a sneak peak check the markdown comments above me.

### v0.3 Release

> TBD
