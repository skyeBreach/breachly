# Automatic Formatting Packages and Configs

Code formatters need to be installed and configured for this package so we can easily uphold the coding standards (without writing more docs)

## Sub-tasks

- [ ] Rust Formatting with `rustfmt`
- [ ] Typescript Formatting with BiomeJS
- [ ] Markdown and MDX Formatting with Remark-Lint
