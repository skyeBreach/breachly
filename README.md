> [!CAUTION]
> **Early Development Warning**
>
> Due to BreachOps-Task being very early in development it is currently **NOT** recommended to use it in any production
> environment.
>
> If you choose to ignore the above **WARNING**, then you do so at your **OWN** risk.

BreachOps-Task is a personal project and task management command-line tool created to help you breach through your
project blockers with minimal effort.

BreachOps-Task has been designed to be as developer-friendly, configurable, and flexible as possible; it achieves
these intended goals whilst keeping a good level portability, high performance, and its compiled binaries minimal in
size.

BreachOps-Task utilizes the Rust language, for its runtime systems, to achieve high performance whilst still being
memory-safe and largly portable. When initially designing BreachOps-Task we did examine other options for runtime
languages but most did not meet our criterion, a list of these languages and our reasoning for not using them can be
found in our [FAQ](docs/faq#why-didnt-you-choose-x-language).

BreachOps-Task is inspired by several other command-line, TUI, and GUI task/project management tools, so if BreachOps-Task
does not meet your criteria then maybe one of [these projects](#acknowledgements) will.

## Features

BreachOps-Task supports the following, non-comprehensive, list of features:

- Free and open-source
- Developer-friendly
- Highly configurable
- Multiple configuration methods
- Lightweight and performant
- Allows for system and project wide management
- And more...

Due to the early stage in development, the features listed here are the intended features that will be included with the
`v1.0.0` release. For a full list of planned features and where they are in development please refer to the
[roadmap](#roadmap) section.

## Installation

As BreachOps-Task is still early in development it has a limited number of installation options, we intend to improve
this later in its life cycle.

BreachOps-Task can currently be installed via the following methods:

### Cargo

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This method requires that you have [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/) installed.
>
> Installation instructions for Cargo can be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
>

Use the following command to install via Cargo:

```shell
cargo install --locked breachops-task
```

Once Cargo finishes running you can start using BreachOps-Task.

## Configuration

Currently, due to its early stage of development, BreachOps-Task can not be configured.

Once the systems required to configure BreachOps-Task are implemented this section will be updated with the relevant
information on how to do this.

## Documentation

Documentation can currently be found in the [docs](docs/index.md) folder of this repository.

Once we have the documentation hosted externally this section will be updated and will provide the relevant links.

## Contributing

## Acknowledgements

A command-line tool for managing tasks and/or tracking time is obviously not a novel or new idea, so it may come as no
surprise that BreachOps-Task was inspired by other similar projects. We feel it is only right to acknowledge and give
